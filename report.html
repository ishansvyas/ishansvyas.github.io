<h1 class="title"> Electromagnetically Induced Transparency
Cooling<br />
ECE 522: Quantum Engineering with Atoms </h1>
<p class="author">Maanav Allampallam, Ishan Vyas</p>
<p class="date">April 2025</p>
</header>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Atomic cooling is a foundational concept in quantum information
science and a necessary capability for any system that traps neutral
atoms or ions. Cooling atoms increases the efficiency of the traps, as
it reduces the probability of the particle jumping out of the trap
(especially necessary for shallow traps like Paul or Penning traps).
Cooling also reduces thermal noise, which increases coherence times and
qubit stability.</p>
<h1 id="doppler-cooling">Doppler Cooling</h1>
<p>Doppler cooling was the first cooling technique which could get close
to the temperatures required for atom/ion trapping systems. The basic
idea is to use a laser to impart a momentum kick on the atom moving in a
direction to reduce its momentum in that direction, thereby reducing its
overall kinetic energy<span class="citation"
data-cites="RevModPhys"></span>. To ensure the momentum kick only
happens in that direction, the laser is red-detuned from the resonant
frequency. When the atom moves in the direction opposite to the laser
propagation, the Doppler shift raises the frequency to resonance,
allowing for photon absorption. However, the absorbed photon is
eventually emitted. While this emission is isotropic <span
class="citation" data-cites="RevModPhys"></span>, meaning there is no
momentum change, it does add kinetic energy to the atom. Hence, there is
an equilibrium between the cooling from the absorption and heating from
the emission. The temperature at this equilibrium is the coldest Doppler
cooling can make a system. Below is a brief derivation based on <span
class="citation" data-cites="RevModPhys"></span> of this lower limit, as
Doppler cooling is not the primary focus of this report.<br />
<br />
We define the cooling force on the laser as <span
class="math display">\[F_c = \hbar k \Gamma \rho _{\pm}\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(\hbar k\)</span> is the momentum of the
absorbed photon and the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \rho
_{\pm}\)</span> is the scattering rate. <span class="math inline">\(\rho
_{\pm}\)</span> is the excited state population and can be derived from
solving the Optical Bloch equations. <span class="math display">\[\rho
_{\pm}= \frac{I/I_{sat}}{2(1 + I_{sat}+ 4\frac{(\delta \mp
kv)^2}{\Gamma^2})}\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span>
is positive if the atom is traveling against the laser, and negative if
it is traveling with the laser.<br />
<br />
We define the energy added through emission as <span
class="math display">\[E_e = \frac{(\hbar k)^2}{2m}\]</span>This is
simply the kinetic energy of the photon.<br />
<br />
Now consider a 1D system with lasers shining to the right and left and a
two-level atom moving to the right. Below are the net cooling force, net
cooling rate <span class="math inline">\(R_c\)</span>, and net heating
rate <span class="math inline">\(R_H\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\sum F_c = \hbar k \Gamma (\rho _+ - \rho
_-)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[R_c = (\sum F_c )v\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[R_H = \frac{(\hbar k)^2}{2m} \Gamma ((\rho
_+ - \rho _-)\]</span> By setting <span class="math inline">\(R_c =
R_H\)</span>, applying the equipartition theorem <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}k_BT^2\)</span>, and
doing some algebra, you get the following as the Doppler limit. <span
class="math display">\[T_D = \frac{\hbar \Gamma}{2k_B}\]</span><br />
<br />
In practice, this temperature is usually around a few hundred
microkelvin. While this is very cold, quantum computing gates require
coherence times for which even a few hundred microkelvin is too high. To
bypass this limit, we use EIT cooling.</p>
<h1 id="theory-of-eit-cooling">Theory of EIT Cooling</h1>
<h2 id="eit-principles-and-setup">EIT Principles and Setup</h2>
<p>Multi-level atomic systems demonstrate transparency when specific
wavelengths of lasers are applied. This transparency effect relies on
quantum interference to function, using the interference to prevent
transitions into an excited state. As a result, electrons become
‘transparent’ to light, as the interference prevents absorption. This
transparency effect is the foundation that allows EIT cooling to
work.<br />
<br />
The system setup is as follows. EIT relies on the existence of a <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> 3-state configuration, where
there exists two stable or metastable states <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{f}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{g}\)</span> and an excited state <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{e}\)</span>. An example of this configuration
is in <span class="math inline">\({}^{40}Ca^{+}\)</span>, where two
<span class="math inline">\(S_{1/2}\)</span> Zeeman sublevels comprise
the stable states <span class="math inline">\(\ket{f}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{g}\)</span> and one of the <span
class="math inline">\(P_{1/2}\)</span> Zeeman sublevels represents the
excited state <span class="citation"
data-cites="RoosExperimental"></span>.<br />
<br />
Figure <a href="#fig:Lambda-system" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Lambda-system">1</a> demonstrates a typical
configuration, complete with laser/state detuning <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta_n\)</span> and slight probe/control

<h2 id="dressed-states">Dressed States</h2>
<p>The application of a strong controlled laser creates a phenomenon
called ‘dressed states’. Dressed states are a result of the
Autler-Townes Effect, also known as the AC Stark Effect. When the strong
coupling laser is turned on, the atom-light interaction between the
laser and the <span class="math inline">\(\ket{g}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{e}\)</span> states changes the eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian <span class="citation"
data-cites="AnisimovATSvsEIT"></span>. Without covering the mechanisms
by which this state shift occurs, we get that the states shift away from
each other by an amount <span class="math inline">\(\delta t\)</span>,
where the ‘ground’ state rises and the excited state lowers. Figure <a
href="#fig:lechner_dress" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:lechner_dress">2</a> illustrates the state dressing
in a 3-level system <span class="citation"
data-cites="LechnerEITCooling"></span>. The resulting state shift is
calculated as: <span class="math display">\[\delta t =
\frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{{\Omega}_c^2 + {\Delta}_c^2} -
|\Delta_c|)\]</span><br />
<br />
These new shifted states are represented by <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{\Tilde{g}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{\Tilde{e}}\)</span>. Though we will discuss
motional sidebands later, it should be noted that the dressed <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{\Tilde{g}, n-1}\)</span> state will almost
exclusively decay into the <span class="math inline">\(\ket{f,
n-1}\)</span> state, so long as the system is within or near the
Lamb-Dicke regime <span class="citation" data-cites="MorigiGS"></span>.
This condition can be proved by examining the expansion of the recoil
operator: <span class="math display">\[e^{i \eta (a + a^\dagger)}
\approx 1 + i \eta (a + a^\dagger) + \mathcal{O}(\eta^2)\]</span><br />
In this case, for <span class="math inline">\(\eta &lt;&lt; 1\)</span>,
the coefficients of the raising/lowering operators are about 0, meaning
the chance of emission changing the motional state of the electron is
near 0.<br />
<br />
Viewing the equation for the state dressing <span
class="math inline">\(\delta t\)</span>, we can see that tuning the Rabi
frequency and detuning of the control laser gives precise control over
the energy eigenstates. This precise state control enables
electromagnetically induced transparency to occur by placing the excited
state in the dark spot of the Fano-type profile, explained in the
sections below.</p>

<h2 id="dark-states">Dark States</h2>
<p>So far, we have strictly considered the implementation of the
coupling laser (<span class="math inline">\(\omega_c\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_c\)</span>) between the stable state <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{g}\)</span> and the excited state <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{e}\)</span>. Let’s now include a weaker probe
laser with natural frequency <span
class="math inline">\(\omega_p\)</span> and Rabi frequency <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega_p\)</span>, set between the metastable
state <span class="math inline">\(\ket{f}\)</span> and the excited state
<span class="math inline">\(\ket{e}\)</span>. As derived in Lambropoulos
and Petrosyan <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lambropoulos2007"></span>, for this example, we will not
include any detuning. We want to analyze the effect of the interaction
between the atom and the incoming lasers. The Hamiltonian of the system
is straightforward: <span class="math display">\[H_0 = \hbar \omega_g
\ket{g}\bra{g} + \hbar \omega_f \ket{f}\bra{f} + \hbar \omega_e
\ket{e}\bra{e}\]</span> The atom-light interaction Hamiltonian is a
separate topic of discussion, and is derivable via the rotating wave
approximation; it is equal to: <span class="math display">\[H&#39;(t) =
-\frac{\hbar}{2}[\Omega_c e^{-i\omega_ct}\ket{e}\bra{g} + \Omega_p
e^{-i\omega_pt}\ket{e}\bra{f}] + h.c.\]</span> We set up the
time-dependent Schrödinger equation, giving: <span
class="math display">\[i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{\Psi(t)} =
[\hat{H_0}+\hat{H&#39;}(t)]\ket{\Psi(t)}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\ket{\Psi(t)}=c_g(t)\ket{g} + c_f(t)\ket{f} +
c_e(t)\ket{e}\]</span><br />
<br />
Using time-dependent perturbation theory, we can arrive at equations
that describe the time evolution of the states. Those equations are:
<span class="math display">\[c_g(t) = c_g(0) \left[
\frac{\Omega_c^2}{\Omega^2} + \frac{\Omega_p^2}{\Omega^2} \cos\left(
\frac{\Omega t}{2} \right) \right]
+ c_f(0) \left[ -\frac{\Omega_p \Omega_c}{\Omega^2} + \frac{\Omega_p
\Omega_c}{\Omega^2} \cos\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2} \right) \right]
- i c_e(0) \frac{\Omega_p}{\Omega} \sin\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2}
\right)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_f(t) = c_g(0) \left[ -\frac{\Omega_p
\Omega_c}{\Omega^2} + \frac{\Omega_p \Omega_c}{\Omega^2} \cos\left(
\frac{\Omega t}{2} \right) \right]
+ c_f(0) \left[ \frac{\Omega_p^2}{\Omega^2} +
\frac{\Omega_c^2}{\Omega^2} \cos\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2} \right)
\right]
- i c_e(0) \frac{\Omega_c}{\Omega} \sin\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2}
\right)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_e(t) = -i c_g(0)
\frac{\Omega_p}{\Omega} \sin\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2} \right)
- i c_f(0) \frac{\Omega_c}{\Omega} \sin\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2} \right)
+ c_e(0) \cos\left( \frac{\Omega t}{2} \right)\]</span><br />
noting that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \sqrt{\Omega_p^2 +
\Omega_c^2}\)</span>. More important than the time evolutions themselves
is the fact that we can choose a starting state of: <span
class="math display">\[\ket{D} = \cos(\theta)\ket{f} -
\sin(\theta)\ket{g}\]</span> of which <span
class="math inline">\(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\Omega_p}{\Omega_c}\)</span>,
where the time evolution into the third state, <span
class="math inline">\(c_e(t)\)</span>, is always equal to 0. This occurs
because the <span class="math inline">\(c_f(0)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c_g(0)\)</span> terms become out of phase by <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and cancel out. Physically, this
effect is called quantum interference, where the excitation of the <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{g}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{f}\)</span> states interfere with each other
and prevent either excitation. In other words, once the electron reaches
the dark state, it cannot evolve into the excited state. The electron
becomes ‘transparent’, where the light passes through without
interacting with the electron. For this reason, we call <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{D}\)</span> the dark state.<br />
<br />
A tangential argument can be made for the state <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{B}\)</span>, defined as the orthogonal state
to <span class="math inline">\(\ket{D}\)</span>. For the dark state
above, we can find: <span class="math display">\[\ket{B} =
\sin(\theta)\ket{f} + \cos(\theta)\ket{g}\]</span> In the state <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{B}\)</span>, transition into the excited
state is at a maximum; as a result, this state is called the ‘bright’
state.</p>
<h2 id="fano-profile">Fano Profile</h2>
<p>We return to our 3-level <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>
system with dressed states and probe and control laser detunings. A
result of electromagnetically induced transparency is the existence of a
Fano profile, shown in the top right of Figure <a
href="#fig:lechner_fano" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:lechner_fano">3</a>. A Fano profile measures the
absorbance of a particular state for various laser detunings, and it is
characterized by a thin band of near-zero absorbance. This region of
minimal absorbance corresponds to the dark state discussed above; a
similar maximum absorbance corresponding to the bright state is slightly
further detuned from the dark state.<br />
<br />
For EIT cooling, our goal is to engineer the system such that the
excited state is in this narrow region of minimal absorbance and for the
lower motional sideband of the excited state, represented by <span
class="math inline">\(\ket{e, n-1}\)</span>, to be in the bright state.
In this case, we would have maximum absorbance into the lower motional
sideband, and due to our system being in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we would
reach a lower motional ground state. That setup is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:lechner_fano" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:lechner_fano">3</a>, where the red dashed line
corresponds to the lower motional sideband, and the blue dashed line
corresponds to the higher sideband <span class="citation"
data-cites="LechnerEITCooling"></span>.</p>
<figure id="fig:lechner_fano">
<img src="lechner_fano.jpg" style="width:50.0%" />
<figcaption>Lechner et al, 2016. Fano-type profile across variable
detuning</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="multi-ion-chains">Multi-Ion Chains</h2>
<p>EIT Cooling is particularly useful for cooling multi-ion chains;
ignoring the lasers needed to set up the <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> configuration, just two lasers
are needed to cool any N chain of ions. The reason for why this is true
relies on our picture of the Fano profile in Figure <a
href="#fig:lechner_fano" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:lechner_fano">3</a>. For cooling to work, we need
two conditions to be true. First, the red sideband needs to exist
somewhere along the enhanced section, close to but not necessarily
exactly on the bright state. Second, the excited state of the same
motional sideband must be aligned with the dark state. Given those
conditions, we do not need to address each individual sideband
frequency; we can instead address all sidebands at once. It is implied
that all ions in the chain have a relatively similar motional mode at
the start of the cooling process; if not, then our laser could not
address ions effectively. Chains of up to 40 atoms at once have been
cooled using EIT methods, though more are theoretically possible <span
class="citation" data-cites="FengTripodEIT"></span>.</p>
<h1 id="experimental-cases">Experimental Cases</h1>
<p>The main advantage of EIT cooling is its ability to simultaneously
cool many ions. As such, we will examine two experimental setups from
Lechner et al. in which long chains of ions were cooled. Lechner et al.
built two EIT cooling setups and used them to simultaneously cool the
radial modes of 9 to 18 <span class="math inline">\(^{40}Ca^+\)</span>
ions. Both setups used the <span class="math inline">\(S_{1/2}
\leftrightarrow P_{1/2}\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(397\)</span>nm) as the cooling transition, the
<span class="math inline">\(D_{3/2} \leftrightarrow P_{1/2}\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(866\)</span>nm) as the repump, <span
class="math inline">\(D_{5/2} \leftrightarrow P_{3/2}\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(854\)</span>nm) as the quench, and finally <span
class="math inline">\(S_{1/2} \leftrightarrow D_{5/2}\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(729\)</span>nm) as the clock frequency (used for
sideband analysis post cooling). Figure 4b. shows a diagram of the
energy transitions. The cooling laser was a diode laser, and the beam
was split to create the dressing and probe beams.</p>

<h2 id="setup-1">Setup 1</h2>
<p>Setup 1 utilized a macroscopic linear RF trap. A magnetic field of
.4mT was used to create an 11.4 MHz Zeeman splitting. Finally, the
dressing beam was blue detuned by 106MHz.</p>
<h2 id="setup-2">Setup 2</h2>
<p>Setup 2 utilized a microfabricated segmented surface trap with a
segment length of <span class="math inline">\(250\mu\)</span>m. A
magnetic field of .33mT was used to create a 9.3MHz Zeeman splitting.
The dressing beam was detuned by 105MHz.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-shortcomings">Results and Shortcomings</h2>
<p>Ground state cooling was achieved with less than 1ms cooling times in
both setups for both 9 and 18 ions (18 and 36 radial modes,
respectively). n was less than 1 by at least two orders of magnitude in
Setup 1 and one order of magnitude less than 1 in Setup 2. The best
cooling rates achieved by Setup 1 and 2 were 19kHz and 17kHz,
respectively. In both setups, ground state cooling was verified by
analyzing the sidebands. Figure 6. shows the before and after for the 9
ion chain. Although not the goal of the experiments, there was observed
heating of the axial modes in both setups. The authors attribute this to
the nonzero projection of the Raman k-vector onto the axial direction
combined with the fact that the axial modes were not in the Lamb-Dicke
regime after Doppler cooling. This caused increased photon scattering
leading to heating. They also mentioned polarization impurities. These
impurities could cause unwanted transitions, break dark state coherence,
and increase uncontrolled scattering.</p>

<p>A fundamental shortcoming of the EIT cooling concept is that, since
it is a fast broadband technique, it lacks the precision of other side
band cooling techniques. However, there is nothing stopping researchers
from combining these techniques. Feng et al. used a "tripod" EIT cooling
scheme to quickly cool down the 36 atoms in their chain at a 3MHz
cooling bandwidth, and then used mode-selective resolved sideband
cooling for more precision. With this, they were able to achieve
ground-state cooling in less than 300 <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>s for ion chains of up to 40
atoms.</p>

<h1 id="future-outlook">Future Outlook</h1>
<p>EIT cooling is one of the most promising cooling technologies for
quantum computing. Its scalability and robustness make it perfect for
quantum computing applications that require many gates. The trend in the
literature has been towards more ions and larger cooling bandwidths, so
it is very possible that EIT cooling becomes the universal first-stage
cooling for quantum computers (followed by more precise methods like
mode-selective RSB cooling). Companies like IonQ and Quantinium are
trying to further increase the scalability by reducing the optical setup
through on-chip EIT beam routing. Researchers at Harvard-CFA have also
begun to utilize EIT cooling for molecules and nanoparticles, expanding
its applications beyond the field of quantum computing. Overall, this is
a very exciting technology with a bright future.<br />
